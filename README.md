# Scrolly plugin

A scrollable sidebar with sections, the section headers stick to the top or bottom of the sidebar when scrolled out of view, and are clickable to expand.

## Features:

*   Sticks section headers to their parent's div edges top or bottom on overflow
*   All heights of sections, headers, and sidebar are flexible
*   Clicking Section title smooth scrolls it to the top
*   Supports window resizing
*   Matching Webflow UI
*   Ticks collapse item, name links to it (Section 2 is collapsed on load)
*   Still scrollable if cursor hovers over fixed item by mousewheel capture
*   Supports DOM injection (Section 7 is loaded in 2 sec on load)

## To-Do:

*   Make collapsing/showing section content smooth scroll work in combination with updating the snapped elements on bottom
*   Clean code
